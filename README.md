This Repository is my implementation for Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) playlist.

I followed the original code in videos, with some modifications and more comments to help me understand the code, you may find it useful too.
